![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0-green)

`Syrup` is a tool that applies super-optimization techniques to optimize Ethereum's smart contracts. In order to do so, `Syrup`
splits smart contracts into basic block, and for each of them, tries to find a sequence of EVM instructions that leads to the same stack
as the original block but spends less gas. 

`Syrup` uses an intermediate representation (Stack Functional
Specification or SFS) on the impact a sequence of instructions has on
a block, and from this representation, a Max-SMT encoding is derived
to find the best translation. The SFS defines the state of the stack
after executing the basic block in terms of the state of the initial stack.

This version of the `syrup` tool is implemented entirely in Python3 and considers further configurations in the Max-SMT encoding
to determine the best options for its usage, as well as more simplification rules.

## Usage

### Input format

`Syrup 2.0` can take either a Solidity smart contract, EVM bytecode,
an isolated basic block or the SFS of a basic block as input. Examples
are available in the following links:
* Solidity smart contracts: https://github.com/costa-group/syrup-python/tree/master/examples/tosem-benchmarks-a
* EVM bytecode:
  https://github.com/costa-group/syrup-python/tree/master/examples/tosem-benchmarks-b
* Basic block: https://github.com/costa-group/syrup-python/tree/master/examples/basic-blocks
* SFS: https://github.com/costa-group/syrup-python/tree/master/examples/blocks

### Output format

`Syrup 2.0` stores all the output from its execution in the folder
_/tmp/syrup/solutions_. For each analyzed contract, it creates three
folders in this directory containing all the relevant information for
each optimized sub-block:

* evm: generated bytecode of the solution.

* disasm: opcodes from the solution, in format human-readable.

* total\_gas: gas associated to each generated block.

`Syrup 2.0` also generates by default a log file in the folder _/tmp/syrup/_ that stores the result from the 
optimization process in term of the solution from each generated Max-SMT problem.
This way, it can be ensured the same optimization results can be obtained when
executing the tool with the same input format. If the log file is not provided, it
cannot ensured this behavior can be replicated, mostly due to the fact that SMT solvers
may lead to different models.

### Max-SMT encoding

`Syrup 2.0` aims to determine the most suitable configuration in order to make the framework feasible to include in _real-world_ compilers. As such, 
there exists several flags that allow the user to specify different combinations of constraints and timeouts. These configurations have been studied in detail and a [visualizer](http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/syrup-visualizer) has been implemented to interpret the experiments. The encoding names used in the visualizer are depicted below.

By default, the encoding that has been determined to work the best so far is enabled. It can be disabled using _-disable-default-encoding flag_.
When disabled, the same encoding as `Syrup 1.0` is produced by default: O'<sub>SFS</sub> + C<sub>L</sub>. The following flags activate different constraints to be included:

* -inequality-gas-model : change soft constraint encoding from O'<sub>SFS</sub> to O<sub>SFS</sub> 
* -pushed-once : enable hard constraint _Numerical values pushed at least once_ or C<sub>N</sub> 
* -no-output-before-pop : enable hard constraint _Restricted opcodes before POP_ or C<sub>R</sub> 
* -at-most : enable hard constraint _Uninterpreted opcodes at most once_ or C<sub>U</sub>

Other flags can be enabled to add other hard constraints or modify the soft constraints. However, they have not been fully checked and it is not guaranteed the produced blocks are indeed equivalent to the initial ones.

The timeout per block can be specified using -tout flag. It is set to 10 seconds by default. When the timeout is reached, the underlying SMT solver halts its execution and returns the best
model so far. If no model was found, empty files are produced.

### Analyze a smart contract

Execute the following command to analyze a provided smart contract:

```
syrup_full_execution.py -s SOURCE -storage [-b] [-isb] [-json] [-solver
                               {z3,barcelogic,oms}] [-v]
                               [-at-most] [-pushed-once] [-tout
                               timeout] [-inequality-gas-model]
                               [-instruction-order]
                               [-no-output-before-pop]
                               [-initial-solution]
                               [-disable-default-encoding]
                               [-number-instruction-gas-model] 
                               [-disable-generation-log-file] [-check-log-file log_file]
```

where the:
* SOURCE represents the source file where the Solidity smart contract,
EVM bytecode, SFS or basic block is stored
* -b is needed when analyzing EVM bytecode
* -isb is needed when analyzing a basic block
* -json is needed when analyzing a SFS
* -solver allows selecting the desired SMT solver
* -v activates the lightweight verifier included in `Syrup 2.0`
* -tout allows specifying a desired timeout for the optimization
  process of each of the basic blocks of the smart contract under
  analysis. It is set to 10s by default
* -disable-generation-log-file Disables the generation of a log file storing the contents
  of the superoptimization process
* -check-log-file accepts the log file generated from a previous run and outputs the same files
* the remaining flags correspond to those related to the Max-SMT encoding that have already
been discussed in the previous section

For instances, to analyze the smart contract [0x001385C23468Cb4614831aD9205F041Cf64A2958.sol](https://github.com/costa-group/syrup-python/blob/master/examples/tosem-benchmarks-a/0x001385C23468Cb4614831aD9205F041Cf64A2958.sol) using
OptiMathSAT as SMT solver, the initial configuration with C<sub>N</sub> and a timeout of 5 seconds, you have to
execute the following command:
```
./syrup_full_execution.py -s examples/tosem-benchmarks-a/0x001385C23468Cb4614831aD9205F041Cf64A2958.sol -storage -solver oms -disable-default-encoding -pushed-once -tout 5
```

## How to reproduce the experiments presented in TOSEM

The directory _examples_ contains the benchmarks used in the
experimental section (Section 5) of the paper (directories
_tosem-benchmarks-a_ and _tosem-benchmarks-b_ respectively) submitted
to TOSEM. The smart contracts located in _tosem-benchmarks-a_ are
those selected for experiments (i) and (ii) and the ones located in
_tosem-benchmarks-b_ the contracts used for experiments (iii).

In order to reproduce the results, you can find the scripts used in
the directory _scripts_:

* Script _process\_benchmarks\_a.sh_ (_process\_benchmarks\_b.sh_
respectively) generates the SFS for all the blocks of the smart
contracts located in the directory _tosem-benchmarks-a_
(_tosem-benchmarks b_ respectively). These scripts generate two new
directories in the root directory of the repository: _results-a_ for
the smart contracts analyzed in the set _tosem-benchmarks-a_ and
_results-b_ for those in _tosem-benchmarks-b_. There, you can find a
new directory _sfs-a_ (_sfs-b_ respectively) with the SFSs generated
for each of the basic blocks.

* Before running the experiments, we need to clean those repositories, i.e 
just leave the json files representing the SFSs for each file. In order to do so, run
script _remove\_jsons\_intermediate\_dir\_benchmark\_a.py_ (_remove\_jsons\_intermediate\_dir\_benchmark\_a.py_
respectively).

* Once, the SFSs are generated you have to execute the script _analyze\_all\_blocks\_in\_contract\_benchmark\_a.py_
(respectively _analyze\_all\_blocks\_in\_contract\_benchmark\_b.py_)
to reproduce the experiments in Section 5.2 and 5.3 (Section 5.4 respectively). This scripts accepts several mandatory 
flags in order to allow multiple configurations to study:

  * -solver {z3,barcelogic,oms}
  * -tout timeout : Timeout in seconds
  *  -syrup-encoding-flags syrup_flags : Flags passed to syrup in order to generate different Max-SMT encodings. If multiple flags are provided, use
  "" to delimit the argument. It is mandatory to start syrup_flags string with a blank space, otherwise the options are not recognized.
  *  -csv-folder csv_folder : Folder in which the results from the experiments are stored. Inside this folder, the subfolder 
  _solver + "\_" + timeout + "s/"_ is created. This subfolder contains a csv file for each analyzed file, containing a row for each sub-block analyzed.

Note that multiple executions of this script can lead to inconsistencies, as all intermediate files are stored in the same folder. This can lead
to name clashing and thus, incoherent results. In order to avoid this behavior, rename the variable _syrup\_folder_ in the file _params/paths.py_
to another name before running again the script.

For instance, if we want to study the initial configuration with C<sub>U</sub> encoding when applied to Z3 and with a timeout of 15 seconds,
run the following command:

```
./analyze_all_blocks_in_contract_benchmark_a.py -solver z3 -tout 15 -syrup-encoding-flags " -disable-default-encoding -at-most " -csv-folder ../results-a/block_results/at_most/
```

As a result, the folder _/results-a/block\_results/at\_most/z3\_15s_ is created.

* Finally, to obtain the global results per configuration instead of having a csv file per file, execute the script 
_generate\_info\_per\_contract\_with\_verifier\_time.py_. This file accepts the path to the _general_ folder that stores all
the experiments and generates a csv file for each encoding. 

For instance, in previous example, the _general_ folder in which we will store the experiments
is _../results-a/block\_results/_. Thus, we need to run the following command: 

```
./generate_info_per_contract_with_verifier_time.py -block-results-folder ../results-a/block_results/ -combined-csvs-folder ../results-a/combined_results/
```
